# PersonalIdea-Reestructure-Rebuild

I have 3 projects going on for this specific app, I was learning initially through them, but now I want to reestructure it from 0 and have it here.
The initial ones had lots of errors because of learning purposes, now I want reestart the project with all the infrastructure and archtecture and documentation detailed here.
It is still a beginner project but I want to organize it and reestructure in this GitHub account. 
I want to finish this small project till 31 january
